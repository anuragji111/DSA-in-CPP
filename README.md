## Question 8 - Array Insertion
This program demonstrates array insertion by shifting elements to the right.

**Concept:**  
In array insertion, if we want to insert an element at a specific index, all elements from that index to the end must be shifted by one position.

**Steps:**
1. Take size and elements as input.
2. Take index and value.
3. Shift elements to the right.
4. Insert new value at given index.

-- Before Deletion (index = 2):
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Shift left:
[10, 20, 40, 50]

Size = 4
